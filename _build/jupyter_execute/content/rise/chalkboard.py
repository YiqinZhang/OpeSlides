# # Chalkboard

# You can turn on the *chalkboard* in the notebook metadata with:
# 
# ```css
#     ...
#     "rise": {
#       "enable_chalkboard": true
#     }
#     ...
# ```

# With the chalkboard reveal plugin, it displays itself with two extra buttons in the lower left area. The first button lets you add free drawings on a blank chalkboard, and the second is to draw on your current slide.

# 
# - `[` to turn the whole space into an empty chalkboard
# 
# - `]` to start adding free drawings to the current slide
# - `\` to download chalkboard drawing
# - `=` to reset chalkboard drawing on the current slide
# - `-` to clear the chalkboard
# 

# ## Eraser

# Long press the right mouse button can turn on the eraser

# ## Change chalk color

# You can change color right after you click the chalkboard button and then press the keyboard `s` to switch to the next color and `q` to switch to the previous color. 
# 
# The default chalk color is <font color='grey'>grey</font>. And other color choices are <font color='blue'>blue,</font> <font color='red'>red, </font>
# <font color='green'>green, </font>
# <font color='orange'>orange, </font>
# <font color='purple'>purple, </font> and

# If you start writing and want to change to another color, double-click the chalkboard button and then press the keyboard 's' or 'q' to choose the color.
